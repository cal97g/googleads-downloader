# NOTE: this set of queries FILTERS BY EFFECTIVELY ENABLED STATE.
# Even though we're getting perf data. It's therefore not possible to re-run
# this later than the structural snapshot without unexpected results.
# A separate version of this query without state filtering exists for use
# if manual re-run after the fact is required.

# NOTE: the behaviour of performance queries using week segmentations seems
# like it's got some bugs at the moment.
# See the thread at https://www.mail-archive.com/adwords-api@googlegroups.com/msg71983.html
# On other time range segments the date filter in the where clause is enough,
# for week, the week segment currently needs to appear in the where.
